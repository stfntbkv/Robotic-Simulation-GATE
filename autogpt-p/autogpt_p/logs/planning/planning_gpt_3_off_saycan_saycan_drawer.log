 The user asks "restock the coke and pepsi into the drawer". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "restock the coke and pepsi into the drawer" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. Restocking implies that the coke and pepsi should be moved from their current locations to the drawer. Therefore, the goal state should include the predicates "on coke0 drawer0" and "on pepsi0 drawer0".

2. To express this in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator, we can use disjunctions. The goal state can be written as follows:

(:goal (or (and (on coke0 drawer0) (on pepsi0 drawer0))))

This goal state states that either the coke0 is on top of the drawer0 and the pepsi0 is on top of the drawer0.

 The user asks "hide the 7up in the drawer". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To determine the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "hide the 7up in the drawer" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user wants to hide the 7up, which means the 7up should no longer be on the counter.
   - Predicate: (not (on 7up0 counter2))

2. The user wants to hide the 7up in the drawer, which means the 7up should be in the drawer.
   - Predicate: (in 7up0 drawer0)

Combining these two predicates, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
(:goal (and (not (on 7up0 counter2)) (in 7up0 drawer0)))

 The user asks "restock the coke into the drawer". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "restock the coke into the drawer" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. Restocking the coke implies that the coke is currently not in the drawer. Therefore, we need to ensure that the coke is no longer on the counter or any other location except the drawer.

2. The coke should be in the container, which in this case is the drawer. So, we need to specify that the coke is in the drawer.

Based on these considerations, the desired goal state can be expressed in PDDL syntax as follows:

(:goal 
  (and 
    (not (on coke0 counter2))
    (not (on coke0 counter1))
    (in coke0 drawer0)
  )
)

 The user asks "I want the spoon to be on the table". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the spoon to be on the table". This request implies that the user wants the spoon to be placed on the table. 

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the request. In this case, the key elements are "spoon" and "table".

Step 2: Identify the action implied in the request. In this case, the action is to place the spoon on the table.

Step 3: Identify the predicate that describes the desired state. In this case, the predicate is "on" which describes an object being on top of a supporting object.

Step 4: Formulate the goal state using the identified predicate and the key elements. The goal state would be the spoon being on the table.

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (on spoon0 table0)))

 The user asks "I want the bowl to be on the counter". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the bowl to be on the counter". This request is straightforward and does not require any complex interpretation. The user wants the bowl to be placed on the counter. 

In the PDDL predicates, the predicate that describes an object being on top of a supporting object is "(on ?o - carry ?s - support)". In this case, the object is the bowl and the supporting object is the counter. 

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be "(on bowl0 counter0)". 

This goal state represents the desired state of the world where the bowl (bowl0) is on the counter (counter0). 

The goal state does not require any disjunctions as there is only one condition that needs to be satisfied. 

So, the final goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (and (on bowl0 counter0)))
----------------------------Results:----------------------------------
Task: I want the bowl to be on the counter
Generated Plan:

 The user asks "I want the tomato to be on the cutting board". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the tomato to be on the cutting board". This request implies that the user wants the tomato to be placed on the cutting board. 

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the request. In this case, the key elements are "tomato" and "cutting board".

Step 2: Identify the action implied in the request. The action here is to place the tomato on the cutting board.

Step 3: Translate the action into a predicate. The predicate that describes an object being on top of a supporting object is "on". 

Step 4: Substitute the key elements into the predicate. The object is "tomato0" and the supporting object is "cutting_board0".

Step 5: Formulate the goal state in PDDL syntax. The goal state is expressed as "(on tomato0 cutting_board0)".

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (and (on tomato0 cutting_board0)))

 The user asks "I want the apple to be in my hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the apple to be in my hand". This request can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify the object: The object in this request is the "apple". 

2. Identify the action: The action in this request is to have the apple "in hand". 

3. Identify the actor: The actor in this request is the "human" (the user).

Given these steps, we can conclude that the goal state is for the apple to be in the hand of the human. 

In PDDL, this goal state can be represented as follows:

(:goal (and (inhand apple0 human0))) 

This goal state indicates that the apple (apple0) is in the hand of the human (human0).

 The user asks "I want the plate to be in my hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the plate to be in my hand". This request can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify the main objects: The main objects in this request are the "plate" and the "hand" of the user. In this case, the user is represented by "human0" and the plate by "plate0".

2. Identify the action: The action in this request is the plate being in the hand of the user. This action corresponds to the predicate "(inhand ?o - carry ?a - actor)" in the domain, where "?o" is the object being carried and "?a" is the actor carrying the object.

3. Substitute the objects into the predicate: Replacing "?o" with "plate0" and "?a" with "human0" in the predicate gives us "(inhand plate0 human0)".

4. Formulate the goal state: The goal state is then expressed as "(goal (inhand plate0 human0))" in PDDL syntax.

So, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (and (inhand plate0 human0)))

 The user asks "I want the sponge to be in my hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the sponge to be in my hand". This request can be broken down into the following components:

1. "I" refers to the human user, which in the problem is represented as "human0".
2. "want" indicates a desired state or goal.
3. "the sponge" refers to the object that the user wants to interact with, which in the problem is represented as "sponge0".
4. "to be in my hand" indicates the desired location of the object, which in this case is in the hand of the user.

From these components, we can determine that the goal state is for the sponge to be in the hand of the human. In PDDL, this can be represented using the "inhand" predicate, which describes the object being in the hand of a human or robot.

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (inhand sponge0 human0)))

 The user asks "I want the spatula to be in your hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the spatula to be in your hand". This request can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify the key components of the request: The key components here are "spatula" and "your hand". The user wants the spatula to be in the robot's hand.

2. Identify the relevant predicate: The predicate that describes an object being in the hand of a human or robot is "inhand". This predicate takes two arguments: the object and the actor.

3. Formulate the goal state: The goal state should reflect the desired outcome of the user's request. In this case, the spatula should be in the robot's hand. Therefore, the goal state should be "(inhand spatula0 robot0)".

So, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

 The user asks "I want the bottle to be in your hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the bottle to be in your hand". This request can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify the key components of the request: The key components here are "bottle" and "your hand". The user wants the robot to hold the bottle.

2. Identify the corresponding predicates: The predicate that describes an object being in the hand of a human or robot is "(inhand ?o - carry ?a - actor)". In this case, the object is the bottle and the actor is the robot.

3. Formulate the goal state: The goal state is then formulated by replacing the variables in the predicate with the identified components. The variable "?o" is replaced with "bottle0" (the specific instance of a bottle in the problem) and "?a" is replaced with "robot0" (the specific instance of the robot in the problem).

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (and (inhand bottle0 robot0)))

 The user asks "I want the hammer to be in your hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the hammer to be in your hand". This request can be broken down into the following components:

1. "I want" - This indicates the user's desire or goal.
2. "the hammer" - This is the object that the user is referring to. In the PDDL problem, it is represented as "hammer0".
3. "to be in" - This indicates the desired state or condition of the object.
4. "your hand" - This is the location where the user wants the object to be. In the PDDL problem, it is represented as "robot0", which is the robot's hand.

From these components, we can conclude that the user wants the robot to hold the hammer. In the PDDL domain, the predicate that describes an object being in the hand of a human or robot is "(inhand ?o - carry ?a - actor)". Therefore, the desired goal state is that the hammer (hammer0) is in the hand of the robot (robot0).

Expressed in correct PDDL syntax, the goal state would be:

(:goal (and (inhand hammer0 robot0)))

 The user asks "I want the tomato to be in the refrigerator". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the tomato to be in the refrigerator". This request is straightforward and can be directly translated into a goal state. 

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the request. In this case, the key elements are "tomato" and "refrigerator".

Step 2: Identify the action or state that needs to be achieved. In this case, the tomato needs to be "in" the refrigerator.

Step 3: Match the action or state with the appropriate predicate from the domain. The predicate that describes an object being in a container is "(in ?o - carry ?c - contain)".

Step 4: Replace the variables in the predicate with the identified key elements. In this case, replace "?o" with "tomato0" (the specific instance of tomato in the problem) and "?c" with "refrigerator0" (the specific instance of refrigerator in the problem).

Following these steps, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (in tomato0 refrigerator0)))

 The user asks "I want the cornflakes to be in the bowl". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the cornflakes to be in the bowl". This request implies that the user wants the cornflakes to be transferred from their current location to inside the bowl. 

In the given predicates, the one that describes an object being in a container is "(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)". This predicate is used to describe the state of an object being inside a container. 

In this case, the object is "cornflakes0" and the container is "bowl0". 

Therefore, the goal state that represents the user's request in PDDL syntax would be "(in cornflakes0 bowl0)". 

This goal state indicates that the cornflakes are in the bowl, which is the desired outcome as per the user's request. 

So, the goal state in the problem would be:

The user request is "I want the tissues to be in the box". This request implies that the user wants the tissues to be placed inside the box. 

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the request. In this case, the key elements are "tissues" and "box".

Step 2: Identify the appropriate predicate that describes the relationship between these key elements. In this case, the predicate that describes an object being in a container is "in".

Step 3: Formulate the goal state using the identified predicate and key elements. The goal state should describe the desired final state of the world after the robot has completed its task. 

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (in tissue0 box0))) 

This goal state represents that the tissue is in the box, which is the desired final state according to the user's request.

 The user asks "I want the milk to be in the bowl". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the milk to be in the bowl". This request can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify the key objects: The key objects in this request are the milk and the bowl.

2. Identify the desired state: The desired state is that the milk is in the bowl.

3. Match the desired state with the appropriate predicate: The predicate that describes a non-liquid object being in a container is (in ?o - carry ?c - contain). However, milk is a liquid, so the appropriate predicate is (liquid_in ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain).

4. Substitute the key objects into the predicate: Substituting the key objects into the predicate gives us (liquid_in milk0 bowl0).

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (and (liquid_in milk0 bowl0)))

 The user asks "I want water to be in a plastic cup". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want water to be in a plastic cup". This request can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify the key elements in the request: "water" and "plastic cup".
2. Identify the action that needs to be performed: The water needs to be put into the plastic cup.
3. Identify the predicate that describes this action: The predicate that describes an object being in a container is "(in ?o - carry ?c - contain)".
4. Replace the variables in the predicate with the identified elements: Replace "?o" with "water" and "?c" with "plastic_cup".

Following these steps, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (in water0 plastic_cup0) (in water0 plastic_cup1) (in water0 plastic_cup2))) 

This goal state represents that the water is in any of the three plastic cups. The disjunction is used because the user did not specify which plastic cup they want the water in, so the goal is achieved if the water is in any of the plastic cups.
The 1st argument of the predicate (in  water0 plastic_cup2) needs to have the type carry.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
I apologize for the confusion. The correct predicate to use in this case is "(liquid_in ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)" since water is a liquid and it needs to be in a container (plastic cup). 

Following the same steps as before, we replace "?li" with "water" and "?lc" with "plastic_cup". 

The correct goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup1) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup2))) 

This goal state represents that the water is in any of the three plastic cups. The disjunction is used because the user did not specify which plastic cup they want the water in, so the goal is achieved if the water is in any of the plastic cups.

 The user asks "I want water to  be in the watering can". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want water to be in the watering can". This request can be translated into the goal state as follows:

1. Identify the key elements in the request: The key elements in the request are "water" and "watering can". The user wants the water to be in the watering can.

2. Identify the appropriate predicate: The predicate that describes an object being in a container is "in". This predicate takes two arguments: the object and the container.

3. Formulate the goal state: The goal state can be formulated by using the "in" predicate with the identified key elements as arguments. The object is "water" and the container is "watering can".

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (in water0 watering_can0))
The 1st argument of the predicate (in  water0 watering_can0) needs to have the type carry.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
I apologize for the confusion. The "in" predicate indeed requires the first argument to be of type "carry". However, in this case, "water0" is of type "liquid". Therefore, we should use the "liquid_in" predicate which is used to describe a liquid being in a container. 

So, the correct goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (liquid_in water0 watering_can0))

 The user asks "I want you to be at the table". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want you to be at the table". This request is straightforward and does not involve any complex actions or conditions. The user simply wants the robot to be at a specific location, which is the table.

Step 1: Identify the key components of the request. In this case, the key components are the robot (you) and the table.

Step 2: Match these components with the predicates defined in the domain. The predicate that describes an actor being at a location is (at ?ob - object ?l - location). In this case, the actor is the robot and the location is the table.

Step 3: Substitute the identified components into the predicate to form the goal state. The robot is represented as robot0 and the table as table0 in the problem definition.

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (at robot0 table0)))

Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want you to be at the refrigerator". This request is straightforward and does not involve any complex actions or conditions. The user simply wants the robot to move to the location of the refrigerator.

Step 1: Identify the key components of the request. In this case, the key components are the robot (the actor) and the refrigerator (the location).

Step 2: Match these components with the appropriate predicates from the domain. The predicate that describes an actor being at a location is (at ?ob - object ?l - location). 

Step 3: Replace the variables in the predicate with the specific objects from the user request. In this case, replace ?ob with robot0 (the robot) and ?l with refrigerator0 (the refrigerator).

Step 4: Formulate the goal state in PDDL syntax. The goal state is expressed as a conjunction of conditions that must be satisfied. In this case, there is only one condition, so the goal state is simply that condition.

The goal state in correct PDDL syntax is:

Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request "I want you to be at me" can be interpreted as the user wants the robot to be at the same location as the user. 

Step 1: Identify the key components of the request. In this case, the key components are "you" (referring to the robot) and "me" (referring to the user or human).

Step 2: Map these components to the predicates defined in the domain. The predicate that describes the location of an actor is "(at ?ob - object ?l - location)". In this predicate, "?ob" refers to the actor (in this case, the robot) and "?l" refers to the location (in this case, the location of the human).

Step 3: Replace the variables in the predicate with the specific objects identified in the user request. In this case, replace "?ob" with "robot0" (as "robot0" is the robot in the problem) and "?l" with "human0" (as "human0" is the human in the problem).

Step 4: Formulate the goal state in PDDL syntax. The goal state would be "(at robot0 human0)".

 The user asks "I want the tomato to be chopped". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the tomato to be chopped". This means that the user wants the tomato to be in a state where it is chopped. 

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the request. In this case, the key elements are "tomato" and "chopped".

Step 2: Match these key elements with the predicates defined in the domain. The predicate that matches "tomato" is "?o - carry" and the predicate that matches "chopped" is "(chopped  ?co - consumable)".

Step 3: Formulate the goal state using the identified predicates and the specific object from the request. In this case, the object is "tomato0" (as defined in the objects of the problem) and the predicate is "chopped".

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (chopped tomato0))) 

This goal state represents that the tomato (tomato0) is in a chopped state, which is what the user requested.

 The user asks "I want the cucumber to be chopped". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the cucumber to be chopped". This implies that the cucumber needs to be in a state where it has been chopped. 

Step 1: Identify the relevant object and action from the user request. In this case, the object is the cucumber and the action is chopping.

Step 2: Look at the predicates defined in the domain to find a predicate that matches the desired action. In this case, the predicate "(chopped ?co - consumable)" is the one that describes a consumable object being chopped.

Step 3: Substitute the object (cucumber) into the predicate to form the goal state. 

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (chopped cucumber0)))

 The user asks "I want the apple to be chopped". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the apple to be chopped". This implies that the user wants the apple to be in a state where it has been chopped. 

Step 1: Identify the object and the desired state
The object in question is the apple (apple0 in the problem definition) and the desired state is that it should be chopped.

Step 2: Identify the predicate that describes the desired state
Looking at the predicates, the one that describes an object being chopped is (chopped ?co - consumable). This predicate takes a consumable object as an argument and describes that it is chopped.

Step 3: Substitute the object into the predicate
Substitute apple0 for ?co in the predicate to get (chopped apple0).

Step 4: Formulate the goal state
The goal state is then expressed as the apple being chopped. In PDDL syntax, this is written as:

(:goal (and (chopped apple0))) 

This goal state represents that the apple (apple0) has been chopped, which is the desired outcome according to the user's request.

 The user asks "I want the bottle to be opened". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the bottle to be opened". This request is straightforward and does not require any complex interpretation. The user wants the state of the bottle to change from being closed to being opened. 

In the given predicates, there is a predicate that describes an object being opened: (opened ?op - open). This predicate can be used to express the goal state. 

The object in question is the bottle, which is referred to as "bottle0" in the problem definition. Therefore, the goal state can be expressed as (opened bottle0). 

This goal state means that the bottle (bottle0) is in an opened state, which is exactly what the user requested. 

So, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (opened bottle0)))

 The user asks "I want the refrigerator to be opened". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the refrigerator to be opened". This request is straightforward and does not require any complex interpretation. The user wants the refrigerator to be in an opened state. 

In the given predicates, there is a predicate that describes whether an object is open or not. The predicate is (opened ?op - open). This predicate can be used to express the goal state of the refrigerator being opened.

The goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (opened refrigerator0))) 

This goal state represents that the refrigerator (refrigerator0) is in an opened state.

Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the door to be closed". This request is straightforward and does not require any complex interpretation. The user is simply asking for the door to be in a closed state. 

In the given predicates, there is a predicate that describes the state of an object being closed: (closed ?cl - close). This predicate can be used to express the goal state of the door being closed.

The object in question is the door, which is represented as door0 in the problem definition. Therefore, we can substitute door0 for ?cl in the predicate to get the desired goal state.

So, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (closed door0))) 

This goal state represents the condition that the door (door0) is closed, which is exactly what the user requested.

 The user asks "I want the counter to be cleaned". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want the counter to be cleaned". This implies that the counter, which is an object, needs to be in a state of cleanliness. In the given predicates, the state of an object being clean is represented by the predicate (clean ?ob - object). Therefore, the goal state should be that the counter is clean.

Step by step conclusion:

1. The user request is analyzed and the main action identified is "cleaned". The object to be cleaned is "counter".

2. The predicates are reviewed to find a match for the action and object. The predicate (clean ?ob - object) matches the action and object in the user request.

3. The goal state is then formulated using this predicate, replacing the variable ?ob with the specific object "counter".

Therefore, the goal state in correct PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (clean counter0)))

 The user asks "I want nothing to be on the counter". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "I want nothing to be on the counter". This means that the counter should be free of any objects. 

In the initial state, we can see that there are several objects on the counter: cornflakes0, tissue0, spoon0, box0, kitchen_knife0, and watering_can0. 

To satisfy the user's request, all these objects need to be removed from the counter. 

In PDDL, the goal state would be expressed as the negation of the predicate (on ?o - carry ?s - support) for each of these objects. 

The goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and
    (not (on cornflakes0 counter0))
    (not (on tissue0 counter0))
    (not (on spoon0 counter0))
    (not (on box0 counter0))
    (not (on kitchen_knife0 counter0))
    (not (on watering_can0 counter0))
)) 

This goal state represents the condition where none of the objects are on the counter, which is what the user requested.

 The user asks "I want the table to be free". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request "I want the table to be free" implies that the user wants the table to be cleared of all objects. In the given problem, the objects on the table are plate0, bowl0, banana0, and apple0. 

To express this in PDDL, we need to negate the predicates that describe these objects being on the table. This is because the goal state is achieved when these conditions (objects on the table) are no longer true. 

The goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and
    (not (on plate0 table0))
    (not (on bowl0 table0))
    (not (on banana0 table0))
    (not (on apple0 table0))
)) 

This goal state represents the condition where none of the objects (plate0, bowl0, banana0, apple0) are on the table, which means the table is free.

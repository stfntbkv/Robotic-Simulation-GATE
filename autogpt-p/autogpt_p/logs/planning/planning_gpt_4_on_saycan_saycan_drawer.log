 The user asks "restock the coke and pepsi into the drawer". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "restock the coke and pepsi into the drawer". This implies that the coke and pepsi should be in the drawer. 

Step 1: Identify the objects involved in the request. In this case, the objects are "coke", "pepsi", and "drawer".

Step 2: Identify the action or state that needs to be achieved. In this case, the coke and pepsi need to be "in" the drawer.

Step 3: Map the request to the appropriate predicate from the domain. The predicate that describes an object being in a container is "(in ?o - carry ?c - contain)". 

Step 4: Replace the variables in the predicate with the identified objects. In this case, replace "?o" with "coke" and "pepsi", and "?c" with "drawer".

The goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal (and (in coke0 drawer0) (in pepsi0 drawer0))) 

This goal state represents that the coke and pepsi are in the drawer.

 The user asks "hide the 7up in the drawer". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "hide the 7up in the drawer". This implies that the 7up should be in the drawer and the drawer should be closed. 

Step 1: Identify the objects involved in the request. In this case, the objects are "7up" and "drawer". 

Step 2: Identify the actions or states that need to be achieved. In this case, the 7up needs to be "in" the drawer and the drawer needs to be "closed". 

Step 3: Map these actions or states to the predicates defined in the domain. The predicate for an object being in a container is "(in ?o - carry ?c - contain)" and the predicate for an object being closed is "(closed ?cl - close)". 

Step 4: Replace the variables in the predicates with the identified objects. The object "?o" in the "in" predicate is replaced with "7up0" and the container "?c" is replaced with "drawer0". The object "?cl" in the "closed" predicate is replaced with "drawer0". 

Step 5: Combine these predicates to form the goal state. The goal state is achieved when both these predicates are true. Therefore, they are combined using the "and" operator. 

The goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (and (in 7up0 drawer0) (closed drawer0)))

Example: Bring me a banana -> (goal: and(inhand banana human))
The user request is "restock the coke into the drawer". This implies that the coke needs to be moved from its current location and placed inside the drawer. 

Step 1: Identify the objects involved in the request. In this case, the objects are "coke" and "drawer".

Step 2: Identify the action that needs to be performed. The action is "restock", which implies moving the coke from its current location and placing it inside the drawer.

Step 3: Identify the current state of the objects. From the problem definition, we know that the coke is currently on the counter1 and the drawer is closed.

Step 4: Define the goal state. The goal state would be that the coke is in the drawer. 

Step 5: Express the goal state in PDDL syntax. In PDDL, the "in" predicate is used to describe an object being in a container. Therefore, the goal state can be expressed as follows:

(:goal (and (in coke0 drawer0)))

This goal state represents that the coke (coke0) is in the drawer (drawer0).

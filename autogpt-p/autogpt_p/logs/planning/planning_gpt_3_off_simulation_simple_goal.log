 The user asks "I want the spoon to be on the table". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and determine the changes required to fulfill it. 

The user request is "I want the spoon to be on the table". 

To fulfill this request, we need to ensure that the spoon is on the table. 

Therefore, the desired goal state can be expressed as follows in PDDL syntax:

(:goal (on spoon0 table0))

Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and convert it into PDDL syntax. The user request is "I want the bowl to be on the counter". 

Step 1: Identify the relevant predicates:

Step 2: Determine the objects involved:
- ?o: bowl0
- ?s: counter0

Step 3: Convert the user request into PDDL syntax:
The goal state can be expressed as follows:
- (on bowl0 counter0)

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:

 The user asks "I want the plate to be in my hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and determine the necessary changes in the predicates to fulfill the request.

Step 1: Identify the object mentioned in the request.
The user request mentions the object "plate".

Step 2: Determine the desired location of the object.
The user wants the plate to be in their hand.

Step 3: Update the goal state.
To express the goal state in PDDL syntax, we need to add the following predicate:
(inhand plate human)

Therefore, the desired goal state is:
(:goal (and (inhand plate human)))

 The user asks "I want the sponge to be in my hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and convert it into PDDL syntax. The user request is "I want the sponge to be in my hand". 

1. The user wants the sponge to be in their hand, which means the predicate "inhand" should be true for the sponge and the human. 
2. We need to add a disjunction to account for the possibility that the sponge is already in the hand of the human. 

Based on these considerations, the desired goal state can be expressed as follows:

(:goal (or (inhand sponge0 human0) (and (not (inhand sponge0 human0)) (inhand sponge0 human0))))

To conclude that the desired goal state is "the spatula to be in your hand", we need to analyze the user request and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user request is "I want the spatula to be in your hand".
2. The user wants the spatula to be in the robot's hand.
3. The predicate for an object being in the hand of an actor is (inhand ?o - carry ?a - actor).
4. The object in this case is the spatula, and the actor is the robot.

Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "I want the bottle to be in your hand" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user wants the bottle to be in the robot's hand. This can be represented by the predicate (inhand bottle robot0).

2. However, we need to consider that the bottle should not be in any other location or container. To ensure this, we can add the following predicates:
   - (on bottle0 table0) - The bottle should be on the table.
   - (closed bottle0) - The bottle should be closed.
   - (closed refrigerator0) - The refrigerator should be closed to prevent the bottle from being inside it.

3. Additionally, we need to ensure that the robot is at the table to pick up the bottle. This can be represented by the predicate (at robot0 table0).

4. Combining all the predicates, the desired goal state can be represented as follows:
   (:goal (and (inhand bottle robot0) (on bottle0 table0) (closed bottle0) (closed refrigerator0) (at robot0 table0)))

Note: The disjunction operator is not required in this case as there are no alternative conditions or choices.

 The user asks "I want the hammer to be in your hand". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude that the desired goal state is "the hammer to be in your hand", we need to analyze the user request and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user request is "I want the hammer to be in your hand".
2. The user wants the hammer to be in the robot's hand.
3. The predicate for an object being in the hand of an actor is (inhand ?o - carry ?a - actor).
4. The object in this case is the hammer, and the actor is the robot.
5. Therefore, the goal state can be expressed as: (inhand hammer0 robot0).

The goal state in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator is:
(:goal (or (inhand hammer0 robot0)))

 The user asks "I want the tomato to be in the refrigerator". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and determine the necessary changes in the predicates to fulfill the request. 

1. The user request is "I want the tomato to be in the refrigerator".
2. We need to identify the current state of the tomato and the refrigerator.
3. From the initial state, we can see that the tomato is currently in the bowl on the table, and the refrigerator is closed.
4. To fulfill the user request, we need to move the tomato from the bowl to the refrigerator.
5. The goal state should reflect this desired change.

Based on the above analysis, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

(:goal 
    (in tomato0 refrigerator0)
)

This goal state specifies that the tomato (tomato0) should be in the refrigerator (refrigerator0).

 The user asks "I want the cornflakes to be in the bowl". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and determine the necessary changes in the predicates to fulfill the request.

Step 1: Identify the relevant predicates:
The relevant predicates for the user request are:
- (on ?o - carry ?s - support): Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
- (in ?o - carry ?c - contain): Describes the non-liquid ?o being in the container ?c

Step 2: Determine the changes needed in the predicates:
Based on the user request "I want the cornflakes to be in the bowl", we need to modify the predicates to reflect the desired goal state. Specifically, we need to ensure that the cornflakes are on top of the bowl.

Step 3: Express the goal state in PDDL syntax:
The goal state can be expressed as follows:

(:goal
  (on cornflakes0 bowl0)
)

This goal state ensures that the cornflakes (cornflakes0) are on top of the bowl (bowl0).

To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "I want the tissues to be in the box" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user wants the tissues to be in the box, so we need to ensure that the object "tissue0" is in the container "box0". Therefore, we can add the predicate "(in tissue0 box0)" to the goal state.

 The user asks "I want the milk to be in the bowl". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "I want the milk to be in the bowl" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user wants the milk to be in the bowl, so we need to ensure that the milk is in the bowl.
2. We can represent this as the predicate (in milk bowl).
3. However, we also need to consider the current state of the world. In the initial state, the milk is in the milk_cartoon0 and the bowl is on the table0.
4. To achieve the goal state, we need to perform the following actions:
   a. Open the milk_cartoon0: (opened milk_cartoon0)
   b. Pour the milk from the milk_cartoon0 into the bowl: (in milk bowl)
5. Therefore, the desired goal state can be represented as:
   (:goal (and (opened milk_cartoon0) (in milk bowl)))

Note: The disjunction operator is not required in this case as there is only one specific goal state mentioned by the user.

Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "I want water to be in a plastic cup" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user wants "water" to be in a "plastic cup". This implies that the "water" should be in the "plastic cup" container.
   - Predicate: (in water0 plastic_cup0)

2. Additionally, we need to ensure that the "water" is not in any other container.
   - Predicate: (not (in water0 ?c - contain))

3. We also need to make sure that the "plastic cup" is not occupied by any other object.
   - Predicate: (not (in ?o - carry plastic_cup0))

Combining these predicates, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
(:goal (and (in water0 plastic_cup0) (not (in water0 ?c - contain)) (not (in ?o - carry plastic_cup0))))

Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and determine the necessary changes in the predicates to fulfill the request. 

The user request is "I want water to be in the watering can". 

Step 1: Identify the relevant predicates:
- (in ?o - carry ?c - contain): Describes the non-liquid ?o being in the container ?c.
- (liquid_in ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain): Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc.

Step 2: Determine the necessary changes in the predicates:
- We need to change the state of the predicate (in water0 watering_can0) to true, indicating that water is in the watering can.

Step 3: Express the goal state in PDDL syntax:
(:goal (and (in water0 watering_can0)))

 The user asks "I want you to be at the table". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude that the desired goal state is for the robot to be at the table, we need to analyze the user request and identify the relevant predicates in the domain.

1. The user request is "I want you to be at the table."

2. The relevant predicate for the robot being at a location is "(at ?a - actor ?l - location)".

3. The user is referring to the robot as "you", so the actor in this case is the robot0.

4. The location mentioned by the user is the table0.

5. Therefore, the goal state can be expressed as follows:

(:goal (at robot0 table0))

 The user asks "I want you to be at the refrigerator". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude that the desired goal state is for the robot to be at the refrigerator, we need to analyze the user request and identify the relevant predicates in the domain.

1. The user request is "I want you to be at the refrigerator".
2. The relevant predicate for the robot's location is "(at ?a - actor ?l - location)".
3. The desired goal state is for the robot to be at the refrigerator, which can be represented as "(at robot0 refrigerator0)".

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator is:

(:goal (or (at robot0 refrigerator0)))

To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and determine the necessary changes in the predicates to fulfill the request.

 The user asks "I want the cucumber to be chopped". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request and determine the necessary changes in the predicates to achieve the desired outcome. 

1. The user request is "I want the cucumber to be chopped". This implies that the cucumber should be chopped, which means the predicate (chopped cucumber0) should be true in the goal state.

2. Additionally, we need to ensure that the cucumber is on the cutting board, as chopping typically happens on a cutting board. Therefore, the predicate (on cucumber0 cutting_board0) should also be true in the goal state.

Based on these considerations, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (and (chopped cucumber0) (on cucumber0 cutting_board0)))

 The user asks "I want the apple to be chopped". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "I want the apple to be chopped" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user wants the apple to be chopped, so the apple should be in the "chopped" state. We can represent this as the predicate (chopped apple0).

Therefore, the desired goal state is:
(:goal (and (chopped apple0)))

Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude that the desired goal state is to open the bottle, we need to analyze the user request and identify the corresponding predicates in the domain. 

1. The user request is "I want the bottle to be opened".
2. From the request, we can identify the object involved, which is the bottle.
3. The action required is to open the bottle.
4. Based on the predicates in the domain, we can express the goal state as follows:

(:goal 
    (opened bottle0)
)

This goal state specifies that the bottle with the object identifier "bottle0" should be opened.

 The user asks "I want the bottle to be closed". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude that the desired goal state is to close the bottle, we need to analyze the user request and identify the relevant predicates in the domain.

1. The user request is "I want the bottle to be closed".
2. The relevant predicate in the domain is "(closed ?cl - close)".

Based on this information, we can express the goal state in PDDL syntax as follows:

(:goal (closed bottle0))

To conclude that the desired goal state is to close the refrigerator, we need to analyze the user request and identify the relevant predicates in the domain.

The user request is "I want the refrigerator to be closed". From this request, we can identify the following relevant predicates:

1. (closed refrigerator0) - Describes that the refrigerator is closed.

To express the goal state in PDDL syntax, we can use the following goal state:

(:goal (closed refrigerator0))

This goal state specifies that the refrigerator should be closed.

 The user asks "I want the counter to be cleaned". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude that the desired goal state is to clean the counter, we need to analyze the user request and identify the relevant predicates in the domain.

1. The user request is "I want the counter to be cleaned".
2. The relevant predicate for cleaning an object is (clean ?ob - object).
3. The object in this case is the counter, so the goal state should include (clean counter0).

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:

(:goal (clean counter0))

 The user asks "I want nothing to be on the counter". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude that the desired goal state is "nothing to be on the counter", we need to analyze the user request and identify the relevant predicates in the domain.

1. The user request is "I want nothing to be on the counter".
2. We need to find the relevant predicates that describe objects being on the counter.
3. The relevant predicate is "(on ?o - carry ?s - support)".

Now, let's express the goal state in correct PDDL syntax without using the ? operator:

(:goal (and
    (not (on ?o - carry counter0))
))
----------------------------Results:----------------------------------
Task: I want nothing to be on the counter
Generated Plan:

; cost = -1 (union cost)
Generated Goal: None
Desired Goal: (and (free  counter0))
Goal Reached: False
Costs are: 0 -- minimal costs: 12
Costs minimal: False
Costs Rate: 0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW CASE ------------------------------------------------------------------
You are the humanoid service robot HIDDEN_FOR_REVIEW assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c
(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)
; Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc
(liquid_in  ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)
; Describes the actor ?a being at the location ?l which can also be another actor
(at  ?a - actor ?l - location)
; Describes the object ?o being in the hand of a human or robot ?a. A human can have multiple objects in their hand
(inhand  ?o - carry ?a - actor)
; Describes the object ?ac being carried together by the actors ?a and ?r
(carried  ?ac - assisted-carry ?a - actor ?r - actor)
; Do not use this predicate
(free  ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(reachable  ?o - carry ?l - location ?a - actor)
; Describes that ?op is open
(opened  ?op - open)
; Describes that ?cl is closed
(closed  ?cl - close)
(warm  ?co - consumable)
(liquid_warm  ?li - liquid)
(wet  ?ws - wet-swipe)
; Describes that a consumable ?co is chopped
(chopped  ?co - consumable)
; Describes that an object ?ob has been cleaned with water
(clean  ?ob - object)
; Describes that the robot has visited the given location ?l
(visited  ?l - location)
; Do not use this predicate
(hand_occupied  ?a - actor)
) 
 and the problem without the goal is:
 (define (problem test)

    (:domain robotic_planning)
    
    (:objects
        banana0 - banana
        plate0 - plate

        tomato0 - tomato
        refrigerator0 - refrigerator
        bowl0 - bowl
        counter0 - counter
    )
    
    (:init 
        (on  sponge0 counter0)
        (at  robot0 counter0)
        (at  human0 table0)

        (closed  door0)
        (on  bowl0 table0)
        (= total-cost 0)
        (= (cost robot0) 1)
    )
    
    (:metric minimize (total-cost))
    
)
 
 The user asks "I want the table to be free". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
Example: Bring me a banana -> (:goal and(inhand banana human))
To conclude the desired goal state, we need to analyze the user request "I want the table to be free" and convert it into PDDL syntax. 

1. The user wants the table to be free, which means there should be no objects on the table. We can represent this as a disjunction of predicates using the "on" predicate:
   (:goal (or (not (on ?o table0)) ...))

2. To ensure that all objects are removed from the table, we need to consider all possible objects that can be on the table. In this case, the objects on the table are banana0, apple0, plate0, and bowl0. Therefore, the goal state should include the negation of the "on" predicate for each of these objects:
   (:goal (or (not (on banana0 table0)) (not (on apple0 table0)) (not (on plate0 table0)) (not (on bowl0 table0))))

3. Additionally, we need to ensure that the objects are not in anyone's hand. We can use the "inhand" predicate to represent this:
   (:goal (and (not (inhand banana0 human0)) (not (inhand apple0 human0)) (not (inhand plate0 human0)) (not (inhand bowl0 human0))))

4. Finally, we can combine both conditions using the "and" operator to express the complete goal state:
   (:goal (and (or (not (on banana0 table0)) (not (on apple0 table0)) (not (on plate0 table0)) (not (on bowl0 table0))) (not (inhand banana0 human0)) (not (inhand apple0 human0)) (not (inhand plate0 human0)) (not (inhand bowl0 human0)))))

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
(:goal (and (or (not (on banana0 table0)) (not (on apple0 table0)) (not (on plate0 table0)) (not (on bowl0 table0))) (not (inhand banana0 human0)) (not (inhand apple0 human0)) (not (inhand plate0 human0)) (not (inhand bowl0 human0)))))

Task: I want the table to be free

; cost = -1 (union cost)

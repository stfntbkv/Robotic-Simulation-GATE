vertical-support: The object can be leaned against safely
 End your answer with listing the affordances as strings in a python list format
A: The user needs the following affordances: grasp, carry, contain, enclosed-contain, open, close. 

These are needed because the user needs to be able to grasp and carry the box (grasp, carry), put items inside it (contain), ensure the items don't fall out when moving the box (enclosed-contain), and be able to open and close the box (open, close).

In python list format, the affordances are:

["grasp", "carry", "contain", "enclosed-contain", "open", "close"]
-----------------------------------------

Q:Which of these objects can replace a box for the affordance enclosed-contain the best. The object(s) are: milk_cartoon,bottle 
 Finish your answer by naming exactly one object with OBJECT:<object>
A: OBJECT:milk_carton
-----------------------------------------

Q:The object milk_carton is not within the given list. Please chose an object from the given list:
milk_cartoon, bottle
A: OBJECT:milk_cartoon
-----------------------------------------

Missing: box - Substitution: milk_cartoon - Desired: ['basket']

grasp: The object can be grasped in any way
carry: The object can be picked up and moved
rotate: The object can be turned
push:  The object can be pushed away from oneself
pull: The object can be pulled towards oneself
dry-swipe: The object can be used to swipe dust or rubble efficiently
 End your answer with listing the affordances as strings in a python list format
A: The user needs the following affordances: 'grasp', 'carry', 'rotate', 'push', 'dry-swipe'.

["grasp", "carry", "rotate", "push", "dry-swipe"]
-----------------------------------------

Q:Which of these objects can replace a broom for the affordance dry-swipe the best. The object(s) are: cloth,hand_brush 
 Finish your answer by naming exactly one object with OBJECT:<object>
A: OBJECT:hand_brush
-----------------------------------------

Missing: broom - Substitution: hand_brush - Desired: ['hand_brush']
Q:Out of the following affordances for a tea_pot, which ones does the user need for the request "I want to heat the tea in the tea pot"? The affordances are:
